# Closest to n and Divisible by m

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given two integers  **n**  and  **m** (m != 0). The problem is to find the number closest to  **n**  and divisible by  **m**. If there is more than one such number, then output the one having the maximum absolute value.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: n = 13, m = 4
Output: 12
Explanation: 12 is the Closest Number to 13 which is divisible by 4.
```

```
Input: n = -15, m = 6
Output: -18
Explanation: Both -12 and -18 are closest to -15 and divisible by 6, but -18 has the maximum absolute value. So, output is -18.
```

 **Constraints:** 
-105 ≤ n, m ≤ 105

```java
class Solution {
    static int closestNumber(int n, int m) {
        int q = n / m;
        int n1 = m * q;
        int n2 = (n * m > 0) ? (m * (q + 1)) : (m * (q - 1));

        if (Math.abs(n - n1) < Math.abs(n - n2)) {
            return n1;
        } else if (Math.abs(n - n1) > Math.abs(n - n2)) {
            return n2;
        } else {
            return (Math.abs(n1) > Math.abs(n2)) ? n1 : n2;
        }
    }
}
```
